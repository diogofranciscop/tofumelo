# Puro Prazer
Static website featuring the recipes I like the most. All the recipes are free from animal products.

# Language Integration
If you would like to have the recipes available in other languages, feel free to fork the repository and translate it.

# Test the website
To see how the website is going just run: `bundle exec jekyll serve`

To test in other dispositive that is in the same wi-fi network run `bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0`

Then for example to access on any other device, just found your IP address and copy paste in your browser: `http://ip_address:4000`. Where you substitue ip_address with you actual ip address.
